### The backup and export tool Pinterest forgot

Pinback is a free, simple bookmarklet that allows you to backup and export your Pinterest data. It runs privately in your web browser and exports your pinned links to a [Netscape Bookmark](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa753582(v=vs.85).aspx)-flavored HTML file. This is the de facto standard among web browsers and services like Delicious, making your data safe and easily portable. “Netscape” also has that wonderful artisanal-aged, vintage-inspired sound to it, don’t you think?

### How does it work?

- Install the “Pinback It” bookmarklet (from source or <http://www.pinback.it>) to your web browser of choice.
- Log in to Pinterest and visit your profile (pinterest.com/username).
- Click “Pinback It” in your browser.
- Choose to export &ldquo;All public pins&rdquo; (all non-private pins, grouped by board), or an individual board (private boards must be exported individually).
- Save exported HTML file to your computer.

### What can I do with the export?

Keep a copy of the HTML file on your computer or Dropbox as a backup. You can open it like a normal web page (just double click the file) to see a list of your pinned items. Your pinned links are just a click away, and that amazing massaged kale recipe is safe from [Pinterest outages](http://www.onlinesocialmedia.net/20141201/pinterest-is-down-globally-engineers-alerted/), accidental deletes, and leafy-green-hating robot overlords.

You can also import your data into your favorite application or web browser. Here are some that are known to support the Netscape format:

- [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/import/instapaper/)
- [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/howto/#import)
- [Dropmark](https://tools.dropmark.com/import)
- [Google Bookmarks](https://support.google.com/bookmarks/answer/178166?hl=en)
- [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/96816?hl=en)
- [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/import-bookmarks-html-file)
- [Safari](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH17154)
- [Internet Explorer](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/211089/en-US)

It’s your data, do as you wish!
